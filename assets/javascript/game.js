//Variables 

    //Comp Score (function that random calculates a total score the user is trying to match at the start of the game and then also re-runs after each user win or loss)

    //Value for Ruby (function that runs when game starts and also after each user win or loss)

    //Value for Diamond (function that runs when game starts and also after each user win or loss)

    //Value for Saphire (function that runs when game starts and also after each user win or loss)

    //Value for Emerald (function that runs when game starts and also after each user win or loss)

    //Wins (starts at 0 - win is when user's total score matches the random score generated by computer)

    //Loss (starts at 0 - loss occurs when user's total score exceeds the random score generated by the computer)

    //User Total Score (starts at 0 and goes up each time the user clicks on an image based on the value of that image during the given game)

//Functions

    //Function to randomly generate total comp score that the user attempts to match
    
    //Function to randomly generate value for Ruby (Would this be a 4 loop??)

    //Function to randomly generate value for Diamond

    //Function to randomly generate value for Saphire

    //Function to randomly generate value for Emerald

//If/Else Statements

    //When user's total score === computer score then the user gets 1 win and then the following functions are called:
        //Comp total score value re-run
        //Ruby, Diamond, Saphire & Emerald value's reset
        //User's total score is reset

    //When user's total score > computer score then the user gets 1 loss and then the following functions are called:
        //Comp total score value re-run
        //Ruby, Diamond, Saphire & Emerald value's reset
        //User's total score is reset
